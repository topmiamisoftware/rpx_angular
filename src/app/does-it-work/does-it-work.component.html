          <h2 class="sb-text-light-green-gradient mt-5">What problem does SpotBie solve?</h2>
          <p>
            Loyalty programs are well known to bring in additional revenue and brand awareness for businesses. Many large franchises and
            retails have in-house loyalty programs. However, some restaurants and retail stores are left with less options to compete because
            they lack the funding for maintaining an in-house loyalty program.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            Alternatively, some businesses use third party loyalty programs that come integrated with POS systems such as Square. While this is a great option, it leaves out
            the focus on building a highly rich loyalty program experience for your users because of their broad focus.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            By signing up through our website, you are becoming part of an unforgettable experience. Not only do we provide an
            integration for businesses to use on their online stores, but we also offer a stand-alone user app on iOS and Android.
          </p>

          <h2 class="sb-text-light-green-gradient mt-5">Growing Brand Awareness</h2>
          <p>
            SpotBie gives businesses an additional tool to grow their brand. Business owners can use SpotBie to deliver their product/service to the right audience,
            to be listed amongst relevant/high standard businesses, and appear in users' local and site-wide results.
          </p>

          <div style="padding-left: 1rem;">
            <h3 class="sb-text-light-green-gradient mt-5">1. Deliver to the Right Audience</h3>
            <p>
              When you are listed on our platform, your business starts attracting users that are one step away from making
              a decision and start spending. The intent each user has when they open the SpotBie app is to look for something that is
              nearby and solve their dinner or shopping plans. Quick and easy, at the tap of three buttons (sometimes two), the user is provided with a list of
              highly rated and reviewed restaurants or retail stores.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sb-text-light-green-gradient mt-5">2. Listed Amongst Excellence</h3>
            <p>
              At SpotBie, you are listed amongst competent restaurants and retails stores that make excellence a habit. To being with,
              we take a look at ratings and reviews from Yelp. If we consider a business is worth taking a closer look at, we go ahead and
              experience their food, products, or services through personal consumption. Yes... that's right, we try them out ourselves! We love delicious food,
              great customer service, and great products so we aren't willing to offer our users anything less!
            </p>

            <h3 class="sb-text-light-green-gradient mt-5">3. Local Results</h3>
            <p>
              Your restaurant or retail store will appear in a map drawn according to the user's distance from your store. In turn,
              this will ramp-up your local brand awareness near your stores' locations. In the other hand, if there are tourists nearby,
              our platform simplifies the user experience so that they can easily see what they have around and closest to them.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sb-text-light-green-gradient mt-5">4. Site-wide Results</h3>
            <p>
              Your restaurant, store, service, or event will also be featured on our site-wide results. This means that people from all
              over the nation can search for your store online and make orders through your website while accumulating loyalty.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2 class="sb-text-light-green-gradient mt-5">Acquisition & Retention</h2>
          <p>
            Loyalty programs offer a huge incentive for guests to visit your store. Here at SpotBie, we've added an extra twist that
            helps bring new customers to your store and retain existing ones.
          </p>

          <div style="padding-left: 1rem;">
            <h3 class="sb-text-light-green-gradient mt-5">1. Local Results</h3>
            <p>
              Our app allows users to instantly find what stores are around them. Once they open the SpotBie app and click on the
              category they are searching for, they are presented with a list of nearby restaurants or stores. This makes it easy
              for users to choose a store, nearing the gap between the prospective user and the end of the marketing funnel.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sb-text-light-green-gradient mt-5">2. Different Loyalty Campaigns</h3>
            <p>
              To keep things entertaining for your customers, we have included the ability to launch different types of
              campaigns. You can choose to award items, discounts, experiences, and run programs such as birthday awards
              and loyalty tiers.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sb-text-light-green-gradient mt-5">3. Compete Locally with other Members</h3>
            <p>
              By adjusting your Dollar-to-Loyalty Point ratio you can adjust the value of loyalty points when users spend
              at your business. Users that look at these businesses thorugh our map or online can then compare reward
              rates and rewards to see where they want to shop.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sb-text-light-green-gradient mt-5">4. Set Limits</h3>
            <p>
              Business owners can set the minimum expense amounts before rewards can be redeemed at their stores.
              Additionally, SpotBie Community Members get to choose how much they want to give out in rewards every month.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sb-text-light-green-gradient mt-5">5. Site-wide Results</h3>
            <p>
              SpotBie also allows users to find site-wide stores through the search function on our website.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sb-text-light-green-gradient mt-5">6. API & Widget Integrations</h3>

              for you.
