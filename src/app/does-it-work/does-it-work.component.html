          <h2 class="sb-text-light-green-gradient">WITH REWARDS & LOYALTY POINTS</h2>

          <h2 class="sb-text-light-green-gradient mt-5">What problem does SpotBie solve?</h2>
          <p>
            Loyalty programs are well known to bring in additional revenue for businesses. Many franchises and
            retails own their own in-house loyalty program. However, smaller restaurants and stores are
            left with less options to compete because they lack the funding for maintaining an in-house loyalty program.
            SpotBie is a solution for small to medium businesses who are looking to build a brand, grow their crowd, and
            create loyalty in their community.
          </p>
          <h2 class="sb-text-light-green-gradient mt-5">Our Vision</h2>
          <p>
            We started SpotBie to build a highly rich experience for the people who love the products and services
            our community members offer and for the ones who provide them; YOU, the business owner.
          </p>

          <h2 class="sb-text-light-green-gradient mt-5">Creating a Community</h2>
          <p>
            Building a loyal audience is a key parameter to your business being successful. With a loyal audience you are almost
            guaranteed to keep an active flow of revenue. Our Loyalty Points system rewards users for such behavior and
            gives them additional reasons to visit your store.
          </p>

          <h2 class="sb-text-light-green-gradient mt-5">Listed amongst Excellence</h2>
          <p>
            At SpotBie, you are listed amongst competent restaurants and retails stores who make excellence a habit. We
            look at ratings and reviews from major platforms and take a closer look at their products and services through
            personal consumption and use... Yes... we try them out ourselves! We love delicious food, great customer service,
            and great products. We aren't willing to offer our users anything less!
          </p>

          <h2 class="sb-text-light-green-gradient mt-5">Delivering to the Right Audience</h2>
          <p>
            When you are listed on our platform, your business starts attracting users that are one step away from making
            a decision and start spending. The intent each user has when they open our app is to look for something that is
            nearby and solve their dinner plans. Quick and easy, at the tap of three buttons (sometimes two), the user is provided with a list of
            highly rated and reviewed restaurants or retail stores.
          </p>

          <h2 class="sb-text-light-green-gradient mt-5">Nearby Results</h2>
          <p>
            Your restaurant or retail store will appear in a list according to its category. Results from this list which you appear in,
            are drawn according to the user's distance from your store. For example, let's say Sam and Frodo are hanging out on a Friday
            night near the beach. Suddenly Sam gets hungry and decides he wants to eat something... he knows where to go. All he
            has to do is tap the SpotBie app and he'll be getting a list of nearby results that are going to offer him a superb experience.
