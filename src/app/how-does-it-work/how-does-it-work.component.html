          <h2 class="spotbie-text-gradient">HOW DOES IT WORK</h2>

          <h2 class="sb-text-light-green-gradient mt-5">
            Sign Up to Our Platform...
          </h2>
          <p>
            You will be able to set your restaurant's or retail store's location
            along with your categories, store description, and store name. After
            you confirm your account, you will be able to upload rewards and
            start awarding your users.
          </p>

          <h2 class="sb-text-light-green-gradient mt-5">Local Exposure</h2>
          <p>
            Your business will be listed in our platform to users who are ready
            to spend. SpotBie users open the SpotBie app because they are ready to
            go to the next step in the sales funnel; and that is making the
            purchase. It's just a question of where they will go now. We
            advertise our local SpotBie Community Members at different times and
            locations. You won't have to worry about managing your ad campaigns
            with us.
          </p>

          <h2 class="sb-text-light-green-gradient mt-5">Loyalty Points</h2>
          <p>
            Our users claim Loyalty Points by making purchases at SpotBie
            Community Member locations. SpotBie users can then claim rewards
            once they have enough points.
          </p>

          <h2 class="sb-text-light-green-gradient mt-5">Upload Rewards</h2>
          <p>
            As the business owner you can upload the best of your menu items
            onto your digital rewards menu to entice your audience. Each reward
            you upload can also carry a minimum spend policy (how much users
            must spend in order to redeem this reward).
          </p>

          <h2 class="sb-text-light-green-gradient mt-5">
            In-Platform Advertising
          </h2>
          <p>
            As part of your membership, you will receive a new in-app Ad design
            every six months. Everyone gets a fair chance for the spot-light in
            our app. Our algorithm assigns SpotBie Community Members Exposure in
            a systematic manner so that all of them get the same amount of
            views.
          </p>

          <h2 class="sb-text-light-green-gradient mt-5">Redeeming Rewards</h2>
          <p>
            Users that go into your business can claim any of the rewards that
            you've listed on your menu as long as they have the Loyalty Point
            balance for it. Additionally, users might be required to gain accesss
            to loyalty tiers before they can redeem certain rewards. This is a great tool
            for your business to thank your most frequent guests with the more exclusive rewards.
          </p>

          <h2 class="sb-text-light-green-gradient mt-5">Award Users</h2>
          <p>
            Award your guests with Loyalty Points at check-out. Simply enter
            their bill value and the SpotBie app will generate a QR code for
            them to scan. After they scan the QR code, the points will be
            transferred to their account.
          </p>
